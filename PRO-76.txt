User 
As a user, I want to request for items of my choice by filling up a form so that I can display information about me and why I want that thing.
As a user, I want to receive a notification if someone has sent me the item so that I know that my request has been responded to.
As a user, I want to confirm that I have received my item so that the donor knows that their book has reached the user.
As a user, I would like to thank the person who gave me the item so that they know the gratitude I feel for them.
